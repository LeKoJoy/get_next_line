# 📜 get_next_line

> A simple and elegant implementation of line-by-line file reading in C — without relying on `libft`.

---

## 🔍 Overview

`get_next_line` is a function that reads a file descriptor line by line. This project is part of the 42 school curriculum, designed to deepen your understanding of file I/O, memory management, and buffer handling in C.

---

## 🛠 Features

- Reads a file **one line at a time**, including the newline character (`\n`)
- Handles multiple file descriptors at once
- Manages memory dynamically and safely
- All helper functions are written **from scratch** — **no `libft` used!**

---

## 🧰 No libft? No problem.

Unlike most implementations, this version doesn't depend on `libft`. Instead, all the necessary utility functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_strjoin`, etc. are implemented in a dedicated `utils.c` and `utils.h`.

✅ Self-contained  
✅ Clean code  
✅ No external dependencies
